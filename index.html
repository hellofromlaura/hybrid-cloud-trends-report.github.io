                        <p>This report examines the latest trends surrounding hybrid cloud adoption, the impact on enterprise infrastructure
                            and operations, and the strategies being utilized to achieve better technology and business outcomes. Unless
                            otherwise noted, the insights and data in this report stem from a global survey conducted by 451 Research on behalf
                            of Cisco, which polled 2,500 IT decision makers in 13 countries. Respondents included cloud computing, DevOps,
                            and enterprise networking professionals from organizations that are advanced users of cloud technologies. (See the
                            Methodology section for further details.)</p>

                                Hybrid cloud models that incorporate both on-prem
                                infrastructure and cloud-based resources have become
                                the enterprise norm, according to our global survey. The
                                vast majority (92%) of the organizations we polled are
                                using multiple public clouds, not only to leverage the
                                unique strengths of those offerings but also to further
                                increase operational agility, application performance, and
                                business resiliency.

                                The respondents of our survey are acutely aware of
                                the challenges these hybrid cloud models create.
                                Many cited cooperation among NetOps, CloudOps,
                                and DevOps teams as a key to overcoming these
                                challenges. Modernizing infrastructure, applications,
                                and operations and aligning them with cloud-native
                                technologies was also seen as an essential enabler of
                                hybrid cloud success.

                                Respondents are adapting to the challenges in operating
                                these environments in a variety of ways. Organizations
                                are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud and using
                                multiple clouds to improve security, performance,
                                business agility and resilience. They see value in
                                cooperation between networking, cloud operations, and
                                DevOps teams. The transition to cloud-native and hybrid
                                cloud is driving DevOps teams to adopt hybrid optimized
                                infrastructures to strike a middle ground between
                                existing and new applications.

                        <p>
                            Most organizations around the world now
                            use multiple clouds to support myriad

                            in business agility and scalability. In the
                            Global Hybrid Cloud Trends survey, 82%
                            of respondents currently use cloudbased Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
                            to host their workloads. This hybrid
                            approach enables organizations to achieve
                            a more agile and scalable development
                            environment (42%) and accelerate

                            the best venue for their workloads today
                            and in the future, the use of multiple
                            clouds has become a popular approach
                            that allows organizations to select the
                            best environment for their workloads,
                            considering factors such as regional

                            The road to hybrid cloud and multicloud use is not without its challenges, and
                            security stands above the rest as the greatest challenge that survey respondents
                            face in using multiple clouds. As noted earlier, security is also the top reason that
                            survey respondents use multiple clouds (37%), as they look to balance security
                            with the needs of performance and scale (42%), while one-third of respondents
                            face challenges related to operational complexity (33%) and managing costs (33%)
                            in these environments. Survey respondents employ various strategies to overcome
                            these roadblocks and demonstrate a strong appetite for implementing new
                            technologies to help them do so.

                            Regardless of where an organization
                            is at in their journey toward multicloud
                            use, security remains a critical challenge
                            as threats are constantly changing,
                            and technology and processes need to
                            adapt. It’s important to keep in mind that
                            security encompasses many aspects of
                            hybrid operations. Operational security
                            concerns are common to any expanding
                            environment, . Hybrid approaches allow
                            organizations to implement one of
                            security’s most fundamental controls,
                            segmentation, as well as isolation, which
                            allows them to use different clouds for
                            different use cases.

                                One factor in the maturing of cloud
                                operations is managing risk by being
                                selective about where workloads and
                                data are placed. Hybrid environments can
                                give security teams options that allow
                                them to balance placement, putting some
                                workloads in public clouds while keeping
                                others on-premises, or using different
                                regions for data residency requirements.
                                While that’s an advantage, it’s one that
                                has risk elements of its own in terms of
                                the additional complexity of operating in
                                multiple, dissimilar realms. Each cloud
                                environment can have its own operational
                                model and management environment.
                                Without a common framework to manage
                                them, security teams need to develop
                                fluency in each new cloud – a significant
                                investment in time and resources.

                            Operational complexity</h3>
                        <p>
                            For one-third of surveyed organizations,
                            the operational complexity driven by
                            the use of multicloud is a key concern,
                            even as there is a proliferation of tools
                            on the market designed to simplify the
                            management of cloud environments.
                            Hybrid environments not only mean that
                            organizations must manage disparate
                            cloud environments, but also different
                            hardware. Many survey respondents
                            (79%) tell us that more than half of their
                            workloads will run on different hardware
                            across all environments, which reinforces
                            the need for a comprehensive toolset for
                            managing workloads regardless of where
                            they reside. For instance, the majority of
                            survey respondents use a cloud-based IT
                            operations platform delivered as a service
                            (94%), which can help an organization
                            quantify operational complexity, provide full
                            lifecycle management, and offer proactive
                            support of on-premises infrastructure – all
                            key capabilities identified by respondents
                            as top criteria in selecting a cloud-based

                                Managing cloud costs can be
                                challenging; however, most

                                driven by the expectation that this
                                approach will help reduce cloud services
                                costs (66% of respondents). Rather,
                                more than half of respondents (56%) use
                                a cost/benefit approach to justify and

                                Cost optimization is one measurement

                                is not a guarantee in the cloud, and it is
                                the ability to connect cloud strategy to

                            that support application development and
                            infrastructure modernization.

                        <p>
                            Survey respondents in cloud operations
                            and DevOps roles indicate that a cloudfirst mandate for all new application

                            toward changing development processes

                            optimization (19%) and automation (18%)
                            are contributing factors. This is another
                            indication of the maturing expectations
                            around cloud environments, as organizations

                            are dealing with legacy applications

                            Regardless of where an organization
                            decides to run a particular application,
                            networking is a critical capability that
                            ensures applications function and perform
                            properly, and developers consider their
                            involvement in determining networking
                            priorities as non-negotiable. The majority
                            of developers either agree or strongly
                            agree (92%) that having a seat at the
                            table in determining their organizations’
                            networking strategy and priorities is
                            important. The importance of networking
                            is reinforced by the frequency with which
                            survey respondents move workloads
                            between off-premises and on-premises
                            environments – 53% move workloads/
                            applications between these venues
                            weekly, while 39% do so monthly.

                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, networking professionals
                            also view this relationship as critical:
                            57% of respondents in networking roles
                            strongly agree that it is important for
                            their DevOps team to be involved in
                            developing their organization’s network
                            strategy. In fact, most developers indicate
                            they already have a process in place to
                            collaborate with networking teams, with
                            71% of DevOps respondents having a
                            regular cadence of meetings with this 
                            team – either weekly (62%) or monthly
                            (9%) – while 8% of respondents describe ad

                        feel their current level of collaboration
                        between DevOps and networking teams
                        is sufficient (83%), there are roadblocks
                        that prevent even more cooperation.
                        Competing priorities between teams
                        (45%), resistance to change (43%) and
                        different objectives and incentives

                        networking teams. Speaking the same
                        language around how networking
                        can drive faster and more effective
                        development and identifying common
                        business goals could go a long way
                        in bringing these teams together. 
                        It is evident that while collaboration is

                    <p>
                        In our survey, 48% of developers note
                        that network reliability is one of the most
                        pressing challenges they encounter.
                        DevOps teams want more visibility into
                        networking issues, and 41% of developers
                        tell us that accessing root-cause analysis
                        is a key challenge they face, along with
                        lack of common tools, platforms and
                        interfaces. More productive collaboration
                        would help developers better understand
                        networking priorities while ensuring that
                        application requirements and business
                        needs are considered as part of the
                        overall networking strategy.

                    <p>
                        The respondents to our survey show
                        keen interest in a range of leading-edge
                        technologies that can benefit from hybrid
                        architectures, including deployment of
                        infrastructure automation (49%), edge
                        computing (41%) and composable
                        infrastructure (27%). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some form of edge computing capability
                        is already deployed by 41% of survey
                        respondents, while an additional 53%
                        expect to deploy edge in the next two
                        years. It’s a technology that has broad
                        application, and hybrid approaches to
                        edge computing can ensure that the
                        right level of capacity is in the right place
                        to optimize application performance and
                        customer experience. Organizations that
                        use 10 or more IaaS cloud platforms
                        were more likely to be further along (57%
                        already in deployment) in edge computing.

                        Infrastructure automation is critical to
                        operating at cloud scale and efficiency,
                        and a slightly larger number of surveyed
                        organizations (49%) reported automation
                        deployment. It’s an area where there has
                        traditionally been underinvestment, and
                        when compared with overall cloud use,
                        there’s a striking difference. Of those
                        organizations with only a single public
                        cloud in use, 39% said automation waysdeployed. 
                        Those with more than 10 clouds
                        in operation reported much higher levels
                        of automation deployment – 55%. This is
                        an indication that automation is becoming
                        mandatory to manage growing hybrid
                        cloud complexity. Tools that leverage
                        automation – such as IT operations
                        platforms delivered as a cloud-based
                        service that support infrastructure lifecycle
                        management – can further help make
                        sense of the complexity in hybrid cloud.

                        The transition to cloud-native application

                        planning to move or refactor production
                        workloads and applications using cloudnative technologies. When you look at
                        the considerations that are driving use of
